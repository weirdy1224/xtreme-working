# Sponsorship
Thank you for considering supporting this project and thus [me](https://github.com/hermanzdosilovic) and my work. There are many ways you can support this project and you might have different motivation or reason to do so. Whatever your reason or motivation is, thank you!

Every donation is valuable and helps me keep this project free and open-source for everybody.

## Common Support

This is the simplest yet very welcome and significant way for you to express your appreciation and support the project with your monthly or one-time donation.

Thank you!

## Development Sponsorship
You can directly sponsor the development of the features, bug fixes or anything that is important to you, your organization or company. For the sake of simplicity in the following text I will just reffer to "features", but remember that it can be anything that you want to see in the project.

Sponsored features are put on the top of the [priority list](https://github.com/judge0/judge0/projects) for one of the next releases and push the development forward by reducing the release cycles.

### Sponsorship Protocol
The protocol for development sponsorship is described below. Described protocol is based on two assumptions:
1. You trust me. I will do the work in the agreed deadline.
2. I trust you. You will donate agreed amount after the work is done.

Moreover, with the following protocol I want to keep everything transparent as possible and in the spirit of the open-source values.

#### 1. Issue Creation
Create a new or choose an existing issue on the [Issues](https://github.com/judge0/judge0/issues) page. It can be anything from feature request, bug fix or documentation update. It can be anything that you would like to see in one of the next releases as soon as possible.

#### 2. Declare Sponsorship
Add a comment that you, your organization or company is willing to sponsor the development of this feature:

```
This feature will be sponsored by [me|ORGANIZATION NAME](URL).
```

It is important to note who is sponsoring the feature because the name of the sponsor (with the given URL) will be written in the release notes.

If you, however, want to stay anonymous then comment:
```
This feature will be anonymously sponsored.
```

Even though the feature is anonymously sponsored it will be noted as such in the release notes.

#### 3. (Optional) Specify Your Deadline
If you have a deadline you want me to meet, please specify it. It can be anything from 1 day to 1 year.

#### 4. Review and Validation
I will then review the feature request and iteratate further with you on its specification before we agree on what exactly will be developed.

This step is important because I want to develop exactly what you are asking for, so we need to be on the same page.

I have a full right to reject and close the issue at any point if it does not match my vision of the direction in which the project should go.

#### 5. Deadline and Offer
I will then tell you in what release this feature can be included and when it can be released. I will also specify the donation amount required for this feature to be developed and released by specified deadline.

Note that even one sponsored feature can make me do a new release.

#### 6. Accept or Reject
You can then accept or reject my donation request:
```
I [accept|reject] your donation request and deadline.
```

Note that if you reject my donation request it doesn't mean that the issue won't be resolved. It just means that it won't be put on the priority list for the next release. It will be treated as any other issue (non sponsored).

If you accept my donation request I will add a label `sponsored` on the issue and forward it for the next stage on [Projects](https://github.com/judge0/judge0/projects) page.

#### 7. Development and Testing
In the development and testing phase I will sometimes send you links to where you can try the new feature.

For some issues this might not be necessary.

#### 8. Release
After the development the issue will be closed and the feature will be released in the specified release cycle within agreed deadline.

After the release I expect you to send the agreed donation amount via [PayPal](https://www.patreon.com/hermanzdosilovic) or [Revolut](https://pay.revolut.com/profile/hermancy5). You can also do this after sixth step.

### Notes
1. Sponsored features **must** stay open-source.
2. One feature can be sponsored by many sponsors.
3. One sponsor can sponsor many features.
